# Data Mining Project - Grenoble's trees

The goal of this project is to gain experience in data mining including data preparation, selection and comparative evaluation of several mining methods.

We have at our disposal a dataset of trees in the city of Grenoble from 2018. This dataset was notably exploited through the project intervened following the organization of the EGC challenge of Grenoble in 2018.

Based on this data, we explored and visualized our data before predicting whether the trees are healthy or have a defect.

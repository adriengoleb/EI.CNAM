# Learning_Analytic Project

One of the main advantages of online platforms over traditional courses at physical institutions is the amount and granularity of data they generate and record. This data is a source of information and can be analyzed to provide insights to students and used to train models capable of predicting their failure/dropout. 

It is in this context that we had to study the OULAD (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset). It contains data on courses, students and their interactions with the Open University Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for seven different courses. The details of the data set are in this site : https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset

In this project, we aim to explore descriptive analysis, clustering, and prediction tools and approaches on the OULAD dataset to address the problem of tracking activities and predicting student failure/withdrawal from the platform. This tool is intended for the student to provide an overview of his or her activities and status within the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).

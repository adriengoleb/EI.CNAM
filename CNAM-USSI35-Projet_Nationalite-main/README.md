# Image Recognition Project

Today, the digitization of paper documents is an important issue in all companies. Being able to access, exploit and store information from these documents is a key issue in the quest for development and increased profits. Data Science and Big Data in the broadest sense of the word are part of this evolution for a better exploitation of data from documents.

We have carried out this year a Data Science project which intervenes in this problematic.

The challenge is to propose an industrialized solution to identify the nationality of an individual from an official document. We have limited the number of documents to the following: visa, identity card or passport.The interest of this project is to be able to automatically identify the nationality of individuals without going through manual, long and repetitive processes that may exist today in some companies.

For that, we used different packages of the Python language in order to answer our complex problem, both from a technical point of view on the recognition but also during the industrialization phase through the development of a visualization interface. 

The realization of the project also led us to widen our problematic by trying to identify the personal information (name and first name) of the individual through one of these official documents and to make a validation of these data with the official data of the INSEE.
